To use the sample code provided, simple run the resultant 
executable after performing a make. The binary expects one
or more files or directories as arguments. If you run the 
code in the background, you can then enter commands and see 
the notification output interleaved with the commands, which 
is useful for educational purposes.

For example: 
dowem@Heliotropic:~/Inotify-article/inotify-sample $ ./inotify_test /home/dowem


This begins a watch on the directory /home/dowem. 
From another terminal simply perform some file creations, deletions etc, 
and watch as the information is presented in real time from the sample
executable. 


We trust that the code helps you understand the inotify Linux kernel 
mechanism. Happy hacking!
